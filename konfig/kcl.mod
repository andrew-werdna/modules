name = "konfig"
version = "0.10.0"
description = "Konfig provides users with an out-of-the-box, highly abstract configuration interface. The original starting point of the model library is to improve the efficiency and experience of YAML users. We hope to simplify the writing of user-side configuration code by abstracting and encapsulating the model with more complex code into a unified model."
