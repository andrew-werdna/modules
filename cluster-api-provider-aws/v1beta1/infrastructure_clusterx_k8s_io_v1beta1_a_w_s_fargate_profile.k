        Conditions defines current state of the Fargate profile.
    failureMessage : str, default is Undefined, optional
        FailureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem
        reconciling the FargateProfile and will contain a more verbose string suitable
        for logging and human consumption.

        This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller

        time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
        fundamentally wrong with the FargateProfile's spec or the configuration of
        the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
        of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
        spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the
        responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.

        Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of
        FargateProfiles can be added as events to the FargateProfile
        object and/or logged in the controller's output.
    failureReason : str, default is Undefined, optional
        FailureReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem

    severity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
