schema Broker:
    r"""
    Broker collects a pool of events that are consumable using Triggers. Brokers provide a well-known endpoint for event delivery that senders can use with minimal knowledge of the event routing strategy. Subscribers use Triggers to request delivery of events from a Broker's pool to a specific URL or Addressable endpoint.

        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
