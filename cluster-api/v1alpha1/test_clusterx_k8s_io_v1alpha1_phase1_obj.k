    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
        the API field changed is acceptable.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A human readable message indicating details about the transition.
        This field may be empty.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, optional

        The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API.
        This field may be empty.
    severity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
