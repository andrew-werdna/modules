    MachinePoolTopology specifies the different parameters for a pool of worker nodes in the topology.
    This pool of nodes is managed by a MachinePool object whose lifecycle is managed by the Cluster controller.

    Attributes
    ----------
    class : str, default is Undefined, required
        class is the name of the MachinePoolClass used to create the pool of worker nodes.
        This should match one of the deployment classes defined in the ClusterClass object
        mentioned in the `Cluster.Spec.Class` field.
    failureDomains : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        failureDomains is the list of failure domains the machine pool will be created in.
        Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object.

        metadata
    minReadySeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        minReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created machine pool should
        be ready.
        Defaults to 0 (machine will be considered available as soon as it
        is ready)
    name : str, default is Undefined, required
        name is the unique identifier for this MachinePoolTopology.
        The value is used with other unique identifiers to create a MachinePool's Name
        (e.g. cluster's name, etc). In case the name is greater than the allowed maximum length,
        the values are hashed together.
    nodeDeletionTimeout : str, default is Undefined, optional
        nodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the MachinePool
        hosts after the MachinePool is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
        Defaults to 10 seconds.
    nodeDrainTimeout : str, default is Undefined, optional
        nodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.
        The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.
        NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout`
    nodeVolumeDetachTimeout : str, default is Undefined, optional
        nodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
        to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        replicas is the number of nodes belonging to this pool.
        If the value is nil, the MachinePool is created without the number of Replicas (defaulting to 1)
        and it's assumed that an external entity (like cluster autoscaler) is responsible for the management
        of this value.
