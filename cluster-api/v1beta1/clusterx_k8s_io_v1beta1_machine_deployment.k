        Defaults to:

        * A new MachineDeployment is created with replicas not set.
        * On an existing MachineDeployment the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
        Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
        * A new MachineDeployment is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
        * An existing MachineDeployment which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler

    providerID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
        This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
        with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
        machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
        generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
        able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
        and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
        This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

    readinessGates : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta1MachineDeploymentSpecTemplateSpecReadinessGatesItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

        This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
        Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
        for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

        Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
        they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

        NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
        NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
        readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
        readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
        This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

    conditionType : str, default is Undefined, required
        conditionType refers to a condition with matching type in the Machine's condition list.
        If the conditions doesn't exist, it will be treated as unknown.
        Note: Both Cluster API conditions or conditions added by 3rd party controllers can be used as readiness gates.
    polarity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        polarity of the conditionType specified in this readinessGate.
        Valid values are Positive, Negative and omitted.
        When omitted, the default behaviour will be Positive.
        A positive polarity means that the condition should report a true status under normal conditions.
        A negative polarity means that the condition should report a false status under normal conditions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    availableReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        availableReplicas is the total number of available machines (ready for at least minReadySeconds)
        targeted by this deployment.
    conditions : [ClusterxK8sIoV1beta1MachineDeploymentStatusConditionsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        conditions defines current service state of the MachineDeployment.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        observedGeneration is the generation observed by the deployment controller.

        phase represents the current phase of a MachineDeployment (ScalingUp, ScalingDown, Running, Failed, or Unknown).
    readyReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        readyReplicas is the total number of ready machines targeted by this deployment.
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        replicas is the total number of non-terminated machines targeted by this deployment
        (their labels match the selector).
    selector : str, default is Undefined, optional
        selector is the same as the label selector but in the string format to avoid introspection
        by clients. The string will be in the same format as the query-param syntax.
        More info about label selectors: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels#label-selectors
    unavailableReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        unavailableReplicas is the total number of unavailable machines targeted by this deployment.
        This is the total number of machines that are still required for
        the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either
        be machines that are running but not yet available or machines
        that still have not been created.

    updatedReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        updatedReplicas is the total number of non-terminated machines targeted by this deployment

    Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.

        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.

        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
