    providerID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.

        This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
        with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
        machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

        able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
        and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.

        readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

        This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
        Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
        for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

        Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
        they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

        NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
        NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
        readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
        readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
        This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

    Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
        the API field changed is acceptable.
    message : str, default is Undefined, optional
        message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
        This field may be empty.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, optional
        reason is the reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.
        The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API.
        This field may be empty.
    severity : str, default is Undefined, optional
        severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.
    status : str, default is Undefined, required
        status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.
    $type : str, default is Undefined, required
        type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lastTransitionTime : str, default is Undefined, required
        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.

        with respect to the current state of the instance.
    reason : str, default is Undefined, required
        reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
