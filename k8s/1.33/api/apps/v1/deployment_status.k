schema DeploymentStatus:
    r"""
    DeploymentStatus is the most recently observed status of the Deployment.

    Attributes
    ----------
    availableReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of available non-terminating pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment.
    collisionCount : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Count of hash collisions for the Deployment. The Deployment controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ReplicaSet.
    conditions : [DeploymentCondition], default is Undefined, optional
        Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        The generation observed by the deployment controller.
    readyReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this Deployment with a Ready Condition.
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment (their labels match the selector).
    terminatingReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of terminating pods targeted by this deployment. Terminating pods have a non-null .metadata.deletionTimestamp and have not yet reached the Failed or Succeeded .status.phase.

        This is an alpha field. Enable DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas to be able to use this field.
    unavailableReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of unavailable pods targeted by this deployment. This is the total number of pods that are still required for the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either be pods that are running but not yet available or pods that still have not been created.
    updatedReplicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment that have the desired template spec.
