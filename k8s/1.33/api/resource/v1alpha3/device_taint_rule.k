    DeviceTaintRule adds one taint to all devices which match the selector. This has the same effect as if the taint was specified directly in the ResourceSlice by the DRA driver.

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is "resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3", required
        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "DeviceTaintRule", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata : metav1.ObjectMeta, default is Undefined, optional
        Standard object metadata
    spec : DeviceTaintRuleSpec, default is Undefined, required
        Spec specifies the selector and one taint.

        Changing the spec automatically increments the metadata.generation number.
