schema SinkBinding:
    r"""
    SinkBinding describes a Binding that is also a Source. The `sink` (from the Source duck) is resolved to a URL and then projected into the `subject` by augmenting the runtime contract of the referenced containers to have a `K_SINK` environment variable holding the endpoint to which to send cloud events.

    kind : str, default is "SinkBinding", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
